# About this project

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe application made applying the contents from the full-stack course with [The Odin Project.](https://www.theodinproject.com/) 

# To-do list 
Below is a personal checklist derived from the instructions for the project.
- [x] Setup initial HTML,CSS and Js files.  
- [x]  Create the `GameBoard` object (*use a module*).
  - [x] Store `gameboard` as an array within the `GameBoard` object.
- [x] Create objects for the two players (*use a factory*). 
- [x] Setup the basic layout of the elements in the HTML file. 
- [x] Create a JS function that will display the content of the "gameboard" onto the webpage. 
  - Tip: At this stage you might want to manually populate the array with X's and O's
- [x] Add basic styling 
- [x] Create function that allows players to make selections for specific spots on the board by clicking on it. 
- [x] Create function that changes the cells based on the selection
- [x] Add logic so no two players can pick the same spot. 
- [x] Create logic that determine if the game is over.
- [x] The game is over when there are 3 checks of the same value or if there's a tie.
- [ ] Add additional improvements, like:
  - [ ] Allow players to put in their name.
  - [ ] Include a button to start/restart the game.
  - [ ] Create display element that congratulates the winner. 
- [ ] **Optional**: Basically add "AI" functionality. 
  - [ ] Add functionality to make the CPU make a random but legal move. 
  - [ ] Make the CPU player smarter (or unbeatable) by using [the minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). Feel free to google.

I plan on using [Ankit Tilwani's TIC TAC TOE - UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1198263701033771263/tic-tac-toe-ui-kit) for the UI among other things.
